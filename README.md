# Automating Hybrid Applications with Appium

This repository will hold the apps and assignments for the workshop **Automating Hybrid Applications with Appium**.

> **NOTE:** If you already cloned this repo, then you can use the following command `git pull` to make sure you have
> the latest code on your machine.

## Introduction:

During this workshop we will dive into the mysterious world of automating Hybrid Apps with Appium by using a demo
Hybrid app which can be found [here](./apps/).\
My advice is to watch the webinar [Automating Hybrid Applications with Appium](https://youtu.be/_mPCRxplBfo) before this
workshop as it handles the theory. It’s not mandatory because I will briefly touch it, but it would really help to
understand the basics.

We will be using:

- a local Android emulator, because this can be used on all platforms (Windows, Mac and Linux).
- WebdriverIO as an automation tool

## Prerequisites

- A Windows, Mac or Linux operating system
- Administrator and/or installation rights on your machine
- Installed NodeJS, this needs to be an even version, so 12 or 14 (No odd versions like 11, 13, 15 which are not stable
  versions)
  > NodeJS 14 is preferred over NodeJS 16 so we can still use WebdriverIO in a synchronous way
- You have downloaded and configured an Android Emulator and/or an iOS Simulator
- Have the latest version of Appium installed on your machine (1.20.0 or higher)
- Some basic JavaScript knowledge

How to set up NodeJS, configure an Android Emulator/iOS Simulator and Appium are explained below.

### Installing NodeJS

If you already have NodeJS installed on your machine then you may skip this step.

There are several ways to install NodeJS, this can be done by:

- downloading it from the [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) website and selecting your environment,
- or by using Node Version Manager.

My advice is to use Node Version Manager because this will give you the ability to easily switch between NodeJS versions in the future.

> **Note:**
> Make sure that if you are downloading NodeJS that you are using even versions with a minimum of NodeJS 12. The odd
> versions (11, 13, 15) are not the stable versions to use. For more information about NodeJS checkout this
> [MeetUp recording of MoT Athens](https://youtu.be/AO49tZYoZ_8?t=4600).

#### Windows:

Follow the instructions for Windows [here](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows).

#### Mac/Linux:

Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

### Setting up an Android Emulator or an iOS Simulator

> You can skip this if you’ve already have an emulator/simulator set up.

Android and iOS both have their own prerequisites. Please follow the installation instructions that can be found
[here](https://youtu.be/BL3ruGJmwwk) to prepare your local machine. This will help you configure your Android Emulator
or iOS simulator.

If you configure your Android emulator, then make sure that you are using Android 10.

### Installing Appium

> If you already have Appium installed on your machine then you may skip this step.

You can follow the instructions, to install Appium on your local machine, by watching
[this](https://youtu.be/AQD1bDX1K-k) video. You don’t need to watch the complete video, the installation part is
mentioned at the beginning and stops at 4:11 min.

As mentioned in the video, make sure you use [Appium Doctor](https://github.com/appium/appium-doctor) to verify if
everything works as expected.

## Test your setup

To make sure everything is working you can execute the following steps:

- Clone the project to your local machine. Open a terminal, go to a folder (or create it) to where you want to store
  this project. Then copy paste the following command in that terminal

          git clone https://github.com/wswebcreation/automating-hybrid-apps.git

- then go into the directory with the following command

        cd automating-hybrid-apps

- when you are in the `automating-hybrid-apps` folder you can install all dependencies with the following command

        npm install

### Testing your Android setup

Make sure you have opened the Android emulator that you configured. Verify that the name of the emulator is the same
as the name in this [Android config](./tests/configs/wdio.android.local.emu.conf.js)-file. If not, then change the
`deviceName` to the name of your emulator.

You can now execute the following command in your terminal

    npm run android.native

This will execute a simple test on your Android emulator and should produce the following logs

```log
npm run android.native

> automating-hybrid-apps@1.0.0 android.native
> npx wdio ./tests/configs/wdio.android.local.emu.conf.js --spec=./tests/specs/android.native.spec.js

### Testing your iOS setup

> This is not mandatory, if you have a Mac you can also check this.

Make sure you have opened the iOS simulator that you configured. Verify that the name of the simulator is the same
as the name in this [iOS config](./tests/configs/wdio.ios.local.sim.conf.js)-file. If not, then change the
`deviceName` to the name of your simulator.

You can now execute the following command in your terminal

    npm run ios.native

This will execute a simple test on your iOS simulator and should produce the following logs

```log
npm run ios.native

> automating-hybrid-apps@1.0.0 ios.native
> npx wdio ./tests/configs/wdio.ios.local.sim.conf.js --spec=./tests/specs/ios.native.spec.js
