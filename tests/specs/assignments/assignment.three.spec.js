/**
 * Assignment 3:  (Complex) WebView Use Cases
 *         Goal:  Learn how to handle selecting (complex) WebViews
 *
 * There are 5 test cases in this test file. Every testcases starts with `it.skip('test-case-name')`. This means that
 * no test case will be executed.
 *
 * 1. We are going to run the first testcase called
 *    `should fail on Android to switch to the correct active Sauce Labs context when we try to verify page titles`,
 *    change the `it.skip` to `it.only` and run the following command in your terminal.
 *
 *    Android:
 *      npm run android.assignment.three
 *    iOS (if you have a Mac):
 *      npm run ios.assignment.three
 *
 *    You should get an error when you run the test because we didn't select the active window in the Android WebView.
 *    When done, change `it.only` back to `it.skip`
 *
 * 2. We are now going to look how Android (and or iOS) provide the WebView contexts by running a testcase that will
 *    print the WebViews to the console. Change the `it` of the testcase `should be able to log all the WebViews`
 *    from `it.skip` to `it.only` and run the following command in your terminal.
 *
 *    Android:
 *      npm run android.assignment.three
 *    iOS (if you have a Mac):
 *      npm run ios.assignment.three
 *
 *    You should now see that testcase `should be able to log all the WebViews` is running and will log how Android will
 *    see the WebViews.
 *    When done, change `it.only` back to `it.skip`
 *
 * 3. To make life a little bit easier for selecting the right WebView for AND Android AND iOS I've created a helper
 *    function which is called `switchToWebView()`. You can find the details in this file
 *      `{project-root}/tests/helpers/WebView.js`
 *    It is a cross platform way of selecting a WebView that will always work. The helper will accept or a (partial)
 *    title or url of the WebView you want to select.
 *    The assignment is to find the title or url you want to use for the following testcases and add the method to one
 *    of the following tests (or all three if you have the time)
 *
 *    - `should be able to switch to the Sauce Demo context and verify an error message`
 *    - `should be able to switch to the Sauce Labs context to see if we can verify a menu item`
 *    - `should be able to switch to the Open Source context to verify a menu item`
 *
 *    Change the `it` of the testcase that you want to run from `it.skip` to `it.only` and run the following command in
 *    your terminal.
 *
 *    Android:
 *      npm run android.assignment.three
 *    iOS (if you have a Mac):
 *      npm run ios.assignment.three
 *
 *    You should now see that the testcase(s) are running and will log and execute the test(s) in the correct context.
 *    When done, change `it.only` back to `it.skip`
